# -Watch-the-main-event-of-UFC-314-will-feature-Alexander-Volkanovski-vs-Diego-Lopes-

Alexander Volkanovski:
Age: 36
Ex-UFC Featherweight King
Resilient, smart fighter with good all-around skills.
Dropped the featherweight belt to Ilia Topuria in February 2024.
Seeking to regain the belt and reestablish his supremacy in the division.
Previous disappointments include a knockout defeat to Islam Makhachev in late 2023. And yet, despite these challenges, Volkanovski is one of the most experienced and determined fighters in the UFC’s featherweight ranks.
Diego Lopes:
Age: 30
Up-and-coming challenger on five-fight winning streak.
Also known for their powerful striking and elite level submissions.
His most recent wins are unanimous decision victory over former title challenger Brian Ortega in September 2024.
Lopes is viewed as one of the most dangerous and versatile fighters in the featherweight division, so this fight is an interesting stylistic matchup.
The victor of this matchup won’t just walk away with the featherweight gold but potentially shape the future of that division. While Volkanovski’s experience and prior championship reign makes him a favorite in the minds of many fans, Lopes’ momentum and all-around skill set guarantee he is a serious threat.
